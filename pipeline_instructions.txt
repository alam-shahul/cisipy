Steps taken during preprocessing:

1. run parse_and_z_project.py, which parses and max z-projects each nd2 file
2. use imagej_stitching.py to calculate stitching in DAPI channel for every tissue/round
3. use stitch_from_coords.py to stitch together images for each gene x round combination and apply median filter
4. run subtract_background.py to register blanks and subtract them from source images
5. use Fiji to determine intensity thresholds for each channel based on previous stitched images (setting max to 150% of min)
6. run apply_channel_thresholds.py
7. run calculate_and_apply_flat_field_correction.py
8. run save_registered_images.py to register across rounds and break into tiles
9. run write_tf_records.py

Ideas for the future:

Segmenting cells.
Using BigStitcher for flat-field correction.
